# Where is this snowflake?

Write a program to find the first non-repeated character in a string.

## How to setup your development environment

- Make sure you are using **python3** (at least 3.6 is available on all major platforms)
- Install VisualStudioCode (other IDEs are fine too)
- Modify the file _src/projects/stringsearch/nonrepeat.py_ and add your code there.
- `__init__.py` turns `stringsearch` into a module and allows other programs and modules to import from it. The provided file should be sufficient.
- Install `pylint`, `black`, `mypy`, `pytest`

  - Windows (Python installed from the App Store)

    ```powershell
    python3 -m pip install pylint, black, mypy, pytest
    ```

  - Windows (Python installed from the downloaded executable)

    ```powershell
    py -3 -m pip install pylint, black, mypy, pytest
    ```

  - Linux (install for the current user)

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --user pylint, black, mypy, pytest
    ```

  - Linux (install for all users)

    ```bash
    sudo python3 -m pip install pylint, black, mypy, pytest
    ```

## How to format, run, and test your solution

- `black`

  ```bash
  python3 -m black src/projects/stringsearch/nonrepeat.py
  ```

- `pylint`

  ```bash
  python3 -m pylint src/projects/stringsearch/nonrepeat.py
  ```

- `mypy`

  ```bash
  python3 -m mypy src/projects/stringsearch/nonrepeat.py
  ```

- `pytest`

  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest tests/projects/stringsearch/test_nonrepeat.py
  ```

- Use terminal to run

  ```bash
  python3 src/projects/stringsearch/nonrepeat.py
  ```

- You may have to use the following command on Windows:

  ```powershell
  py -3 src/projects/stringsearch/nonrepeat.py
  ```

## How to submit your solution

- Submit your modified `nonrepeat.py` to KATIE.
  - There is no need to submit data and test files, I already have them.
