# Is it a heap or is it a pile?

Complete the following tasks:

1. Show each step of turning list `[42, 35, 71, 34, 76, 39, 77, 47, 6, 20]` into a _min_ heap.

   - The following is an example of heapifying `[55, 73, 17, 41, 83, 89, 7, 28, 10, 69]`.

   | Step | List                                  |

2. Show each step of turning list `[42, 35, 71, 34, 76, 39, 77, 47, 6, 20]` into a _max_ heap.

   - The following is an example of heapifying `[69, 10, 28, 7, 89, 83, 41, 17, 73, 55]`.

   | Step | List                                  |
