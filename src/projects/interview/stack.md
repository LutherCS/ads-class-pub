# Insert coin to win a stupid prize

This is a completely artificial project that has no practical application or relevance. It is based on the essay [The Perils of Programming as Puzzle
](https://mcorrell.medium.com/the-perils-of-programming-as-puzzle-67145b4accd) by
Michael Correll. I hope you never see this question outside of the classroom.

## Task

Implement a `stack` data structure using `queue` data structure as a basis. For the sake of simplicity use `SimpleQueue` of the built-in module `queue`.

See the class and method descriptions in the `stack.py` for implementation details and requirements. Method `__init__` has been implemented and _cannot_ be changed.

## What to do

`python` should be `python3.9` or newer.

- Read _src/projects/interview/description.md_ (this file).
- Modify _src/projects/interview/stack.py_.

- Test your implementation.

```bash
python -m pytest tests/projects/interview/test_stack.py
```
