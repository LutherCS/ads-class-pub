# Sort of

Complete the following exercises and submit your answer to KATIE as a single file (archive).

You can complete this exercise either manually (paper and pencil) or by modifying the implementations of the algorithms provided in the textbook and pythonds3 to print status after each iteration.

1. Sort list `[15, 16, 73, 65, 38, 10, 22, 79, 87, 64]` using _Insertion_ sorting algorithm. Show every step of the process.
2. Sort list `[15, 16, 73, 65, 38, 10, 22, 79, 87, 64]` using _Selection_ sorting algorithm. Show every step of the process.
3. Sort list `[15, 16, 73, 65, 38, 10, 22, 79, 87, 64]` using _MergeSort_ algorithm. Show every step of the process.
4. Sort list `[15, 16, 73, 65, 38, 10, 22, 79, 87, 64]` using _QuickSort_ algorithm. Show every step of the process.
5. Sort list `[15, 16, 73, 65, 38, 10, 22, 79, 87, 64]` using _HeapSort_ algorithm. Show every step of the process.

The provided output file contains the results of using various algorithms to sort list `[594, 850, 281, 952, 129, 348, 264, 972, 598, 758]`.

The provided output file contains [ANSI color codes](https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting). These codes are supposed to change the view of the **console** output and your text editor is unlikely to support them. Use `cat` (linux/Mac) or `type` (Windows) to see output in colors.

The value is marked **red** while under review and **blue** once it's settled in its final position.

* Linux/Mac

```bash
cat tests/exercises/sorting/sorting_output.txt
```

* Windows

```bat
type tests\exercises\sorting\sorting_output.txt
```
